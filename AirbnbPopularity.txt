ID: 9632
You are given a table named airbnb_host_searches that contains data for rental property searches made by users. Determine the minimum, average, and maximum rental prices for each popularity-rating bucket. A popularity-rating bucket should be assigned to every record based on its number_of_reviews (see rules below).


The host’s popularity rating is defined as below:
•   0 reviews: "New"
•   1 to 5 reviews: "Rising"
•   6 to 15 reviews: "Trending Up"
•   16 to 40 reviews: "Popular"
•   More than 40 reviews: "Hot"


Tip: The id column in the table refers to the search ID.


Problem: Output host popularity rating and their minimum, average and maximum rental prices. Order the solution by the minimum price.

import pandas as pd


pd.options.display.float_format = "{:,.2f}".format

df = airbnb_host_searches.copy()

def popularity(x):
    if x == 0:
        return "New"
    elif 1 <= x <= 5:
        return "Rising"
    elif 6 <= x <= 15:
        return "Trending Up"
    elif 16 <= x <= 40:
        return "Popular"
    else:
        return "HOT"

df["host_popularity"] = df["number_of_reviews"].apply(popularity)

result = (
    df.groupby("host_popularity")
    .agg(
        min_price=("price", "min"),
        avg_price=("price", np.mean),
        max_price=("price", "max"),
    )
    .reset_index()
    .sort_values(by="min_price")
