Problem: Write a query that will calculate the number of shipments per month. The unique key for one shipment is a combination of shipment_id and sub_id. Output the year_month in format YYYY-MM and the number of shipments in that month.
Givens: shipment_id:int64 | sub_id:int64 | weight:int64 | shipment_date:datetime64[ns]

Solution:

import pandas as pd

df = amazon_shipment
df['yearMonth'] = df['shipment_date'].dt.strftime('%Y-%m')

groupedDF = df.groupby('yearMonth')['shipment_id'].count().reset_index()

groupedDF

-----Output-----
yearMonth	shipment_id
2021-08	        3
2021-09	        6
